# Welcome to IdentityServer4

IdentityServer4 is an OpenID Connect and OAuth 2.0 framework for ASP.NET Core.

It enables the following features in your applications:

* Authentication as a Service
  > Centralized login logic and workflow for all of your applications (web, native, mobile, services). IdentityServer is an officially certified implementation of OpenID Connect.

* Single Sign-on / Sign-out
  > Single sign-on (and out) over multiple application types.

* Access Control for APIs
  > Issue access tokens for APIs for various types of clients, e.g. server to server, web applications, SPAs and native/mobile apps.

* Federation Gateway
  > Support for external identity providers like Azure Active Directory, Google, Facebook etc. This shields your applications from the details of how to connect to these external providers.

* Focus on Customization
  > The most important part - many aspects of IdentityServer can be customized to fit your needs. Since IdentityServer is a framework and not a boxed product or a SaaS, you can write code to adapt the system the way it makes sense for your scenarios.

* Mature Open Source
  > IdentityServer uses the permissive Apache 2 license that allows building commercial products on top of it. It is also part of the .NET Foundation which provides governance and legal backing.

* Free and Commercial Support
  > If you need help building or running your identity platform, let us know. There are several ways we can help you out.
